# HashGenerator
A utility written in Java to display MD5, SHA1 &amp; SHA256 hashes for offline files.

This utility uses Apache Commons Codec for the hash generation process
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/download_codec.cgi

The utility worked fine on both windows and Linux platforms , the problem was with macOS since the jFileChooser used didn't work the way it did with the mentioned platforms.
